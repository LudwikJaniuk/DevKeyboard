# DevKeyboard

DevKeyboard is a simple program that I created for a school project. When the QWERTY keyboard was originally created in 1867 it was designed for one purpose: to create an optimal keyboard layout for writers. Back in 1867, there were no computers, coders, or programs around, so no one thought to put the curly brace or the equals sign in an easy to reach place. Today, coders around the world still use a 148 year-old keyboard designed for writing. The QWERTY keyboard wasnâ€™t designed for coders, but the DevKeyboard is. Feel free to use any of the code I've written and feel free to change it. Please feel free to download and edit any of the code I have written!
